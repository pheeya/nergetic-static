									<span class="t2">How To Purchase</span>
									<p>Before purchasing make sure that you meet all the requirements of the service you want to purchase.
                        PC Requirements: None
                        PS4 Requirements: 200K, 2FA Off, PS Plus
                        After that, simply click on "Buy Now", enter the details that are asked of you on the popout window and hit "checkout".
                        After that you will be redirected to the checkout where you have to fill in your Billing Information,
                        Select Payment Method & Delivery Type.  After you are done with those 3 steps click on "Place Order"
                        and you will be redirected to NGPay where you will need to fill in your payment method information.
                        After you complete the payment, you will receive an Invoice and a Receipt at the billing e-mail address
                        you provided us. You will also receive the order completion email there which would indicate that your order
   has been completed</p>
								</div>
								<div class="tutorial">
									<span class="t2">How To Use Modded Account</span>
									<p>After you purchase a modded account it could go take up to 1-20 days for the delivery.
                        We will send you an e-mail notification with the account credentials.
                                    </p>
									<p>After that locate the email
                        and the account credentials and turn on your PS4 console.
    Press the PS Button and instead of signing in to your current account select the "New User" option. </p>
									<p>After that select "Create a User"  and enter your account credentials information. Follow the on-screen
                        instructions until you successfully log in to your new account.
Finally, just open GTA 5, play the prologue and you're set to go.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="tutorial">
									<span class="t2">What To Do After Purchase</span>
									<p>After purchasing a PS4 Booster you will receive an e-mail notification confirming the delivery which include a full guide on how to avoid bypassing the daily selling limit.
                        We recommend selling 1-2 vehicles a day so you don't hit the daily selling limit which could result in your cars being sold for a little amount of gta money. You can find your vehicles stored in multiple garages, sometimes even at a second character if the boost purchased is big enough.
                        Important: make sure that you pull your console off the plug as soon as you receive the completion e-mail so your PS4 resets and the boost is saved.
As for PC things are way simpler as you only have to sign back and play with your new boost. It is recommended to not let the account stay inactive as it could be a reason that could cause a ban.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="tutorial">
									<span class="t2">Order In Progress</span>
									<p>How can you know if the process starts? On PS4, you are free to play during the waiting of your delivery but you are required to have your console turned off completely while the modder is signed in.</p>
									<p>
                            You can know if the modder is signed in 
																									
										<br/>
										<br/> 1) if you get signed out or you receive an E-Mail that an individual from Russia has logged in your account 
																									
										<br/> 2) Or if you log in and you kick the modder, the modder will attempt to sign in once again.
In both situations are you are required to pull the console off the plug and not plug it again until you receive an e-mail about the completion of your order.
